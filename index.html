        Hello! I’m Parham Moeini, a dedicated Computer Science student at York
        University in Toronto. With a strong foundation in both backend and
        frontend web development, I am passionate about creating dynamic and
        efficient web applications.
        <br /><br />
        My journey began with a fascination for technology and programming,
        leading me to explore various aspects of web development. I have honed
        my skills in backend technologies like Python and Django, and frontend
        frameworks including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My experience extends to
        working with databases, APIs, and web scraping techniques, enabling me
        to build robust and scalable solutions.
        <br /><br />
        At York University, I am deepening my knowledge in computer science
        while applying my skills in real-world projects. I enjoy the challenge
        of solving complex problems and am always eager to learn new
        technologies and techniques to enhance my development skills.
        <br /><br />
        I am committed to using my expertise to build innovative solutions and
        am excited about opportunities that allow me to contribute to meaningful
        projects.
        <br /><br />

        <br />This Django project, developed by Parham Moeini, is an apartment
        search portal that allows users to search for rental listings in various
        cities. The project leverages web scraping techniques to gather real
        estate data from platforms like Zumper and Apartments.com.
        <br />The extracted information, such as pricing, address, and contact
        details, is presented to users in an organized and user-friendly format
        on the website. After fetching all the data, the program also produces a
        Excel file for each sourse and let user download the file.<br />
        The project includes features like, login/sign up system, user
        authentication, seamless search functionality, and dynamic data display,
        making it easy for users to find available apartments based on city
        input.
